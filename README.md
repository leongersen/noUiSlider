# noUiSlider

noUiSlider is lightweight JavaScript range slider, originally developed to be a jQuery UI alternative.

It features cross-browser support, a wide range of options and support for a bunch of touch devices. It has been tested on Android phones, iPhone & iPad, Windows phone and touch-screen laptops and tablets and desktops.

All modern browsers and [IE8+](#browser-support) are supported. The end result? A lean, extendible and bloat-less plugin that'll just do its job.

The best part? noUiSlider has no dependencies! As of version 8, **jQuery is no longer required!**

Oh, and the licensing terms are simple: [just Do What the Fuck You Want](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/) with it.

Bower
-----
Bower users can install all compiled and minified files easily using `bower install nouislider --save`. Supporting bower unfortunately means keeping all compiled and minified versions in the repository.

Browserify
----------
This library is [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) compatible, so you can use it in this way:

```javascript
var noUiSlider = require('nouislider');

var slider = document.getElementById('slider');

noUiSlider.create(slider, {
  start: 40,
  connect: "lower",
  range: {
    min: 0,
    max: 100
  }
});
```

Browser support
---------------

All major browsers are supported. **To support IE8** you'll need to shim several ES5 features.

You can use [polyfill.io](https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/docs/) to easily do so:

```html
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=Edge">
<!--[if lte IE 8]>
<script src="https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js"></script>
<![endif]-->
```

Version numbering
------------------------------
Version numbering follows the 'Semantic versioning' style.
You'll find an excellent documentation at [Semver.org](http://semver.org/).
