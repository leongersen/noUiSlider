# noUiSlider

noUiSlider is lightweight plugin, developed to be a jQuery UI alternative. It features cross-browser support, a `just-another-input-type` style of getting and setting values, a wide range of options and support for a bunch of touch devices. It works wonders on Android phones, iPhone & iPad, Windows phone and touch-screen laptops and tablets. It works excellent on the desktop too; All modern browsers and IE7+ are supported. The end result? A lean, extendible and bloat-less plugin that'll just do its job. To add even more flexibility, noUiSlider is compatible with both jQuery and Zepto.js. Oh, and the licensing terms are simple: [just do what you want](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/).

Documentation
-------
An extensive documentation, including **examples**, **options** and **configuration details**, is available here: [noUiSlider documentation](http://refreshless.com/nouislider/).

Bower
-----
Bower users can install all compiled and minified files easily using `bower install nouislider --save`. Supporting bower unfortunately means keeping all compiled and minified versions in the repository.

Unit Testing
------------
Unit tests where overhauled for noUiSlider 7. Most code is now covered, with events testing being slightly lacking due to it's browser dependant nature.

Browserify
----------
This library is [CommonJS](http://www.commonjs.org/) compatible, so you can use it in this way:

```javascript
var jquery = require('jquery');
require('nouislider')(jquery);

console.log('Is noUiSlider loaded?');
console.log(typeof jquery.fn.nouislider === 'function');

jquery(".shor").nouislider({
  start: 40,
  connect: "lower",
  range: {
    min: 0,
    max: 100
  }
});
 
jquery(".svert").nouislider({
  orientation: "vertical",
  start: 40,
  connect: "lower",
  range: {
    min: 0,
    max: 100
  }
});
```

Version numbering
------------------------------
Version numbering follows the 'Semantic versioning' style.
You'll find an excellent documentation at [Semver.org](http://semver.org/).

Contributing

The plugin code can be managed using a Grunt-based task runner.
Use `npm install` to fetch all dependancies, then `grunt concat` to merge all files.
